# marketplace-realtime-microservice
A standalone high-concurrency WebSocket microservice built with Node.js, Socket.io, and Redis. Designed for real-time messaging in a Laravel + Flutter marketplace ecosystem. Handles stateless JWT authentication, Redis Pub/Sub event consumption, and room-based broadcasting. Fully decoupled from the core backend for maximum scalability.
